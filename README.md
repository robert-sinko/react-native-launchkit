**A Clear Canvas for Rapid React Native Exploration, Inspired by Bulletproof React**

`React Native Launchkit` is a streamlined starter project built to help you dive into React Native development quickly and confidently. Inspired by the [Bulletproof React project structure](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/blob/master/docs/project-structure.md), it comes pre-configured with popular tools and integrations‚Äîincluding full Expo + Firebase setup and essential authentication screens (sign in, sign up, sign out). With a clean, scalable foundation, you can focus on building, experimenting, and shipping faster.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Instant Setup with Expo:** Get up and running quickly with Expo's developer tools and services.
- **Firebase Integration:** Leverage the power of Firebase for backend needs like authentication and data storage.
- **NativeWind Styling:** Enjoy the utility-first approach to styling with NativeWind (Tailwind CSS for React Native).w
- **Redux for State Management:** Implement robust and predictable state management with Redux.
- **Dark Mode Support:** Provides light/dark modes.
- **Essential Screens Included:**
  - **Login:** A ready-to-use login screen.
  - **Register:** A registration screen for new users.
  - **Home (Playground):** The central screen where you can start building and testing your React Native ideas.
  - **Settings:** A basic settings screen for customization.
- **Clear Canvas Approach:** Provides a minimal yet functional starting point, allowing you to easily add and customize features within a structured environment.
- **Adheres to Bulletproof React Structure:** Adopts a scalable and maintainable project organization for long-term growth.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robert-sinko/react-native-launchkit
cd react-native-launchkit
```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3.  **Set up firebase**

- Create a new Firebase project.
- Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

- Fill in the necessary Firebase credentials in .env.local.

4.  **Start the Expo development server:**

```bash
npx expo start
# or
yarn start
```

This will open the Expo Go app on your simulator/emulator or physical device (if you have it set up).

## üõ†Ô∏è Included Integrations

- **Expo:** Simplifies React Native development with tools for building, deploying, and updating your app.
- **Firebase:** A comprehensive platform for mobile and web development, offering services like authentication, database, storage, and more.
- **NativeWind:** Brings the utility-first CSS framework Tailwind CSS to React Native for rapid styling.
- **Redux:** A predictable state container for JavaScript apps, helping you manage complex application state.
